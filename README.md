- This started out as a simple build with just one button to generate the random number, but then I wanted to give the user the ability to define the upper and lower limits for the random number.
- So I added 2 input fields that would define upper and lower limits, and a button to clear the input fields.
- I also added an alert if the user tries to generate a random number without defining those number limits.
